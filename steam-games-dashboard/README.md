2. **Folder Path Configuration in Power BI**  
   The Power BI report uses a parameter called **FolderPath** to point to the location of the `games.csv` file. To make the report work on your machine:

     ```
     C:\Users\NAME\Desktop\power-bi\steam-games-dashboard\data\
     ```
     Update this to match your local path to the `games.csv` file.

3. **Refresh Data**  
   Once the **FolderPath** is updated, you can refresh the data by clicking **Refresh** in Power BI Desktop.
